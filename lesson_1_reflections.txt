How did viewing a diff
between two versions of a file
help you see the bug that was introduced?
when you look after errors in your code
there are lots of correct-errors
so you may have some typos that you may thing they are correct
in that case, compare different versions of your code will help

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
 make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can imagine that, by having access to the entire history of a file,
you have a better idea of what's going on

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
The good thing is that you can save your code evrytime you make an 
important change. The bad thing is that you must remember to do it,
if not, you might loose your work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git handel a project as a unity (Repository)
independently of its number of files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?
Gif log give general information about recent commits and 
git diff compare two commits

How might using version control make you more confident 
to make changes that could break something?
It makes you feel more condifent beacuse 
you can proof different things and, if there is any bug, 
you can return to a previous state

Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?
I'll try to use git for changing bugs in my code
