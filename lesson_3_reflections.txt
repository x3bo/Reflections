When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use remote repository if I want to share my work with others 
and/or if I wnat to work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Beacuse not always it is necessary to share all your commits. 
Some times it is more interesting to share a group of commits 
that helps others to have a whole idea of what you are working on.
